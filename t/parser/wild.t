indented prose handling
=======================

test code begins with an indented line starting with
the command leader ("$ " by default), continues with
optional continuation lines ("> " by default), 
output lines (indented lines *not* starting with either
leader), through exit code line ([%d]).

any other indented lines are prose (ie. not tests).

setup::

  $ # exit 80

  $ cat > indents.t <<\EOF
  > prose
  >   indented prose
  > 
  > more prose
  > 
  >   more indented prose
  >   even more indented prose
  >   $ echo hello; (exit 42)
  >   hello
  >   [42]
  >   whoa, indented prose!
  > EOF
